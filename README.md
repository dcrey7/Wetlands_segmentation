# Wetland Localization Using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning  

## üåç Project Overview  
This project aims to **automate wetland detection** using **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery** and **deep learning segmentation models**. Wetlands are critical for biodiversity, carbon storage, and water filtration, but mapping them manually is resource-intensive. Our solution leverages AI to provide scalable, efficient monitoring tools for environmental conservation.

**Key Features**:  
- **Semantic segmentation** of wetlands using U-Net and DeepLabV3+ models.  
- **Cloud detection** pipeline to filter unusable satellite images (LightGBM classifier).  
- **Interactive web app** for visualizing predictions and wetland coverage.  
- Open-source implementation with Hugging Face Spaces deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach  

### **1. Data Pipeline**  
- **Data Source**: 36 Sentinel-2 images (2021‚Äì2023) of a French wetland area (62√ó357 pixels, 10 spectral bands).  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Patched images into 62√ó62 tiles (180 total patches).  
  - Applied padding (128√ó128) to preserve mask quality.  
  - Augmented data with flips, rotations, and random crops.  
- **Class Imbalance**: Wetlands covered only **8.93%** of the area ‚Üí Used **Dice Loss** to handle imbalance.  

### **2. Models**  
| Model               | Architecture          | Input Bands | Test mIoU | Key Insight |  
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|  
| DeepLabV3+ (FT)     | ResNet-34 encoder     | RGB         | **52.71** | Best generalization |  
| U-Net (FT)          | ResNet-34 encoder     | RGB         | 50.80     | Overfitted on training data |  
| Small U-Net         | Custom lightweight    | 12 bands*   | 46.85     | Struggled with limited data |  

*Included NDVI, NDWI, and 10 Sentinel-2 bands.  

### **3. Cloud Detection**  
- **Model**: LightGBM (F1-score: **0.77**) using Coefficient of Variation (CV) features from 10 bands.  
- **Impact**: Filtered 19.4% cloudy patches to improve segmentation accuracy.  

---

## üöÄ Results  
- **Best Model**: Fine-tuned DeepLabV3+ achieved **10.02% wetland IoU** (vs. 5.34% for U-Net).  
- **Limitations**: Low resolution (54.85m/pixel) and small dataset hindered performance.  
- **Future Work**:  
  - Integrate Sentinel-1 radar data for cloud-free analysis.  
  - Scale to 1000+ high-res patches and test Swin U-Net architectures.

### ‚ú® Why This Matters  
This project bridges **AI** and **ecology**‚Äîproving that scalable, open-source tools can accelerate wetland preservation. By optimizing models for the web (e.g., transformers.js), we aim to make environmental monitoring accessible to everyone.  

**Join us in building the future of WebML for sustainability!**
